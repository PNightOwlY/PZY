The recent accession of the important state of North Carolina to the Constitution of the United States (of which official information has been received), the rising credit and respectability of our country, the general and increasing good will toward the government of the Union, and the concord, peace, and plenty with which we are blessed are circumstances auspicious in an eminent degree to our national prosperity. \n",
      "In resuming your consultations for the general good you can not but derive encouragement from the reflection that the measures of the last session have been as satisfactory to your constituents as the novelty and difficulty of the work allowed you to hope. Still further to realize their expectations and to secure the blessings which a gracious Providence has placed within our reach will in the course of the present important session call for the cool and deliberate exertion of your patriotism, firmness, and wisdom. \n",
      "Among the many interesting objects which will engage your attention that of providing for the common defense will merit particular regard. To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace. \n",
      "A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies. \n",
      "The proper establishment of the troops which may be deemed indispensable will be entitled to mature consideration. In the arrangements which may be made respecting it it will be of importance to conciliate the comfortable support of the officers and soldiers with a due regard to economy. \n",
      "There was reason to hope that the pacific measures adopted with regard to certain hostile tribes of Indians would have relieved the inhabitants of our southern and western frontiers from their depredations, but you will perceive from the information contained in the papers which I shall direct to be laid before you (comprehending a communication from the Commonwealth of Virginia) that we ought to be prepared to afford protection to those parts of the Union, and, if necessary, to punish aggressors. \n"

Still, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families. So I hope we can work together this year on bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform, and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse. We just might surprise the cynics again. \n",

Don't worry, I've got plenty, from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients. And I'll keep pushing for progress on the work that still needs doing. Fixing a broken immigration system. Protecting our kids from gun violence. Equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage. All these things still matter to hardworking families; they are still the right thing to do; and I will not let up until they get done. \n",
      "But for my final address to this chamber, I don't want to talk just about the next year. I want to focus on the next five years, ten years, and beyond. \n",
      "I want to focus on our future. \n",
      "We live in a time of extraordinary change, change that's reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet and our place in the world. It's change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families. It promises education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away. It's change that can broaden opportunity, or widen inequality. And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate. \n"

    "     The wc utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in each input file, or standard input (if no file is specified) to the standard output.  A line is defined as a string of characters delimited by a <newline> character.  Characters beyond the final <newline> character will not be included in the line count.\n",
    "\n",
    "     A word is defined as a string of characters delimited by white space characters.  White space characters are the set of characters for which the iswspace(3) function returns true.  If more than one input file is specified, a line of cumulative counts for all the files is displayed on a separate line after the output for the last file.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The following options are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "     -c      The number of bytes in each input file is written to the standard output.  This will cancel out any prior usage of the -m option.\n",
    "\n",
    "     -l      The number of lines in each input file is written to the standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "     -m      The number of characters in each input file is written to the standard output.  If the current locale does not support multibyte\n",
    "             characters, this is equivalent to the -c option.  This will cancel out any prior usage of the -c option.\n",
    "\n",
    "     -w      The number of words in each input file is written to the standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "     When an option is specified, wc only reports the information requested by that option.  The order of output always takes the form of line, word, byte, and file name.  The default action is equivalent to specifying the -c, -l and -w options.\n",
