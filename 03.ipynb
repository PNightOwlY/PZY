Each daughter maps to a father (there is no immaculate conceptions here!).  More than one daughter can map to the same father (some fathers have more daughters!).

Lots of keys can map to the same image value ($Jenny$ and $Cathy$ have the same father, $Anu$ and $Ashu$ have the same father), but the idea is that we can uniquely identify the value we want if we know the key.   This means that we can't have multiple identical keys.   This makes sense when you look at how the map works.   We use the map to find values from the key, as we did when we found $Anu$'s father above.   If we had more than one $Anu$ in the set of keys, we could not uniquely identify the value that maps to the key $Anu$.\n",

Many well-known names associated with probability worked on problems to do with gambling:  people like Bernoulli and Pascal did quite a lot of work in this area ...  even Newton was persuaded to set down some of his thoughts about a game involving dice (in a letter to a Samuel Pepys). \n",

    "So we have probabilities associated with events satisfying some axioms --  that sounds like a good use for a dictionary?   That's basically what are going to use, but we 'wrap' up the dictionary in some extra code that does things like check that the probabilities add to 1, and that each element in the list of outcomes we have given is unique.   If you are interested in programming, we have coded our own type, or class, called `ProbyMap` (it's given in the next cell, and you can simply evaluate it and ignore all the details completely!).   Once the class is coded, we create a `ProbyMap` by providing the sample space and the probabilities.   You don't have to worry about how the class is implemented, but note that you may often want to use the computer to create a **computerised representation of a mathematical concept**.  Once the concept (a discrete probability map in our case) is implemenetd, then we can use the computer to automate the mundane tasks of large-scale computations.\n",
